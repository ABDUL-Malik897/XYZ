| ------ | -------------- | --------------- |

| PUT    | /api/todos/:id | Update a todo   |
| DELETE | /api/todos/:id | Delete a todo   |

##  Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. CORS Issues

**Problem:** Frontend couldn’t communicate with backend.

**Solution:** Used proxy in React (`package.json`) instead of configuring CORS manually.

---

### 2. State Not Persisting After Reload

**Problem:** Tasks were resetting or showing incorrect status.

**Solution:** Ensured proper backend fetch (`GET API`) on component load using `useEffect`.

---

### 3. Delete Without Confirmation

**Problem:** Tasks were deleted instantly.

**Solution:** Added confirmation popup:

```js
if (window.confirm(`Do you want to delete ${todo.Title}`)) {
   handleDelete(id);
}
```

---

### 4. Scroll Not Working Properly

**Problem:** Task list overflow issue.

**Solution:** Applied CSS:

```css
overflow-y: auto;
max-height: 300px;
```

---

### 5. Deployment Confusion

**Problem:** Changes not reflecting after updates.

**Solution:** Learned that backend must be **re-deployed after every change**, not just committed.


##  Run Summary

1. Start backend → `npm run dev`
2. Start frontend → `npm start`
3. Open browser → `https://todo-list-appln.vercel.app/`
